This programme will function as a fitness tracker, allowing the user to
input details on exercises and workouts, and track goals.
The user will be provided with a menu, with options to create an exercise
and add it to the database. They will also be able to view or delete an
exercise by category.
Users can create a workout routine, made up of each exercise, as well as to
track their progress for each movement.
Finally, they will be able to choose from a pre-determined fitness goal, and
can track this by entering their distance travelled/weight lifted.
